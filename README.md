## Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project
### Project Overview
This project explores sentiment analysis on Twitter using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build effective models that can predict the sentiment expressed in tweets, capturing the nuances of human language. The evaluated models are: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), all of which showed promising results in handling the complexities of tweet-based text.

### Models Evaluated
* Logistic Regression: Accuracy - 75%
* Support Vector Machines (SVM): Accuracy - 75%
* Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): Accuracy - 74%
Each model was subjected to a hyperparameter tuning process to optimize their performance.

### Key Contributions
* Developed a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline for tweet data which includes cleaning, normalisation, tokenisation and vectorisation using TF-IDF.
* Applied advanced machine learning algorithms to classify sentiments, refining the models through rigorous hyperparameter tuning.
* Analysed the performance of each model using accuracy scores and confusion matrices to identify the best performer in real-world scenarios.

### Dataset
The dataset consists of 300,000 tweets balanced between positive and negative sentiments, obtained from Kaggle. Each tweet includes multiple attributes such as sentiment, tweet ID, date, query, username, and the text itself.
